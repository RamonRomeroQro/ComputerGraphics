/**********************************************************************

***********************************************************************/
I have been working on this for about 2 weeks on and off.

/**********************************************************************

 * How can I make this assignment better?
 **********************************************************************/
I think the hardest part of this assignment was the correct shading and 
shadow calculation, as well as mirroring. I wasn't able to implement 
mirroring as I did not understand the math.

I think we would have bennefited a lot more by breaking up the assignment 
in parts and having multiple deliverables, transformations, raytracing, 
shadows, mirroring, etc. That way if we had questions it would just afect
us in one lab, and the professor could have helped us between assignments.
